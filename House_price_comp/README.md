# House Price Prediction - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains the notebook and data used for a house price prediction competition on Kaggle.

## Data Cleaning

The included dataset has been carefully cleaned to ensure its quality for modeling. This involved handling missing values, outliers, and any other inconsistencies that could impact the model's performance.

## XGBoost Model

I implemented an XGBoost model to predict house prices based on the features in the dataset. XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm well-suited for this type of regression task.

## Results

This project achieved a final ranking of **583th out of 97,474** participants! This is a very strong result for a first attempt at a Kaggle competition.

## Further Exploration

This repository provides a solid foundation for further exploration of house price prediction models. You can experiment with different feature engineering techniques, model architectures, and hyperparameter tuning to potentially improve the model's performance.
